Community [![Discord]](https://discord.com/widget?id=1231237037106008144)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The IIaaS community generally hangs out [on Discord](https://discord.com/widget?id=1231237037106008144), so please drop
by if you have any questions, comments, concerns, wishes, hopes, dreams, wants, needs, yearnings, musings, or idle
curiosities about IIaaS. We love meeting new people and talking with them about how they can best use IIaaS to solve
their IaC problems. We know there are gaps in IIaaS, and definitely lots of new, powerful capabilities to add, so
hearing about what's working and what could be better will help drive the direction of IIaaS.

If you have other thoughts, or are running into trouble and are not able to get help from the community on Discord,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/paion-data/immutable-infrastructure-as-a-service/issues) describing your problem or idea.
