ELK Release Definition Template
===============================

hashicorp-aws offer a [Screwdriver template][Screwdriver CD template] that deploys
[immutable][Immutable Infrastructure] instances of ELK to AWS. It uses the [screwdriver-template-main npm package] to
assist with template validation, publishing, and tagging. The template tags the latest versions with the `latest` tag.

How to Use This Template
------------------------

### Installing Template in Screwdriver

The template needs to be installed first in Screwdriver running instance. Installation has two parts:

1. [the template](https://github.com/QubitPi/hashicorp-aws/tree/master/adaptors/screwdriver-cd/templates/elk-sd-template.yaml)
2. Some [pre-defined Screwdriver commands][Screwdriver CD - commands] that this template uses

The template and the commands can be automatically installed using the regular [screwdriver.yaml] config file by
following the steps below:

1. [Create a Screwdriver pipeline][Screwdriver CD - creating a pipeline] with the repository link being
   `https://github.com/QubitPi/hashicorp-aws.git`
2. Trigger a pipeline run, which will install the templates and commands automatically. Wait the pipeline to finish
   running.
3. The installed template and commands can be found in [Templates page][Screwdriver CD - finding templates] and
   [Commands page][Screwdriver CD - finding commands], respectively

### Using the Template

[Create a Screwdriver pipeline that uses this template][Screwdriver CD - creating pipeline from template] with the
`screwdriver.yaml` file of

```yaml
---
jobs:
  main:
    requires: [~pr, ~commit]
    template: paion-data/elk-release-definition-template@latest
```

The following [Screwdriver Secrets][Screwdriver CD Secrets] needs to be defined before running the pipeline:

- [`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`](../setup#aws)
- [`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`](../setup#aws)
- `SSL_CERTIFICATE` - the content of SSL certificate file serving HTTPS-enabled DNS name of the EC2 hosting our ELK
  instance. This is the same as the `SSL_CERTIFICATE` from the
  [general SSL setup of hashicorp-aws](../setup#optional-setup-ssl)
- `SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY` - the content of SSL certificate key file serving HTTPS-enabled DNS name of the EC2 hosting our
  ELK instance. This is the same as the `SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY` from the
  [general SSL setup of hashicorp-aws](../setup#optional-setup-ssl)

To run the pipeline, fill in the AWS-related **parameters** first

Then hit "**Submit**" to start deploying.

:::warning

Once the pipeline deploys ELK, we must remember to do the
[post setup in EC2 instance](index#post-setup-in-ec2-instance).
